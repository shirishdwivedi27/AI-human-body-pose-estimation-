## Features
- **Human Pose Estimation:** Utilizes the MediaPipe library to estimate key points in the human body.
- **Exercise Counting:** Counts the number of exercises performed by the user based on detected poses.
- **Incorrect Exercise Detection:** Provides a beep indication for incorrect exercise postures.
- **Real-time Processing:** Integrates OpenCV for real-time video processing.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python (version 3.x)
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Other dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## More features
- Human body pose estimation using MediaPipe
- Exercise counting functionality
- Incorrect exercise detection with beep indication
- OpenCV integration for real-time processing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-human-pose-estimation.git
   cd ai-human-pose-estimation
